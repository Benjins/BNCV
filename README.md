## BNCV
=========

A while ago I realised that computer vision and image processing code is something I had a use for. This is hopefully a place for me to dump tools + code that I create for it.

Atm, it is very bare bones. As in...there's not really anything here. But some possible stuff:

 - Image format conversions
 - Blurs
 - Edge detection

Also, no machine learning. Ever.
